# About Me  
I am a graduate student in the Department of Computer Science at UIC. I grew up in India, where I also completed my bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science. Before joining graduate school, I worked for 2.5 years as an analyst in a corporate setting.  

Outside of academics and work, I enjoy reading fiction books, binge-watching series, and painting.  

# Research Interests  
My research interests are centered on **data science, visualizations, and automation**. Iâ€™m particularly interested in how data can be communicated more effectively through interactive and visual tools, as well as in building automated systems that make data insights more accessible.  

# Coursework  
Some of the graduate courses I have taken include:  
- CS401: Computer Algorithms  
- CS418: Introduction to Data Science  
- CS412: Introduction to Machine Learning  
- CS588: Secure Networked and Distributed Systems  
- CS594: Responsible AI Engineering  
- CS421: Natural Language Processing  
- CS529: Visual Data Science
