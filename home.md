# About Me  
Iâ€™m a graduate student in the Department of Computer Science. Iâ€™m from India, where I completed my bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science before working for 2.5 years as an analyst in a corporate setting. I enjoy reading fiction, binge-watching good series, and painting when I need a creative reset.

Iâ€™m curious by nature and love turning messy datasets into clear stories. I value clean, reproducible workflows and thoughtful visualization. Iâ€™m happiest when Iâ€™m learning with others, and leaving documentation better than I found it.

# Research Interests  
My research interests are centered on ***data science, visualizations, and automation***. Iâ€™m particularly interested in how data can be communicated more effectively through interactive and visual tools, as well as in building automated systems that make data insights more accessible.  

# Coursework  
Some of the graduate courses I have taken include:  
- **CS401**: Computer Algorithms  
- **CS418**: Introduction to Data Science  
- **CS412**: Introduction to Machine Learning  
- **CS588**: Secure Networked and Distributed Systems  
- **CS594**: Responsible AI Engineering  
- **CS421**: Natural Language Processing  
- **CS529**: Visual Data Science
