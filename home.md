# About Me  
I’m a graduate student in the Department of Computer Science. I’m from India, where I completed my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science before working for 2.5 years as an analyst in a corporate setting. I enjoy reading fiction, binge-watching good series, and painting when I need a creative reset.

I’m curious by nature and love turning messy datasets into clear stories. I value clean, reproducible workflows and thoughtful visualization. I’m happiest when I’m learning with others, and leaving documentation better than I found it.

# Research Interests  
My research interests are centered on ***data science, visualizations, and automation***. I’m particularly interested in how data can be communicated more effectively through interactive and visual tools, as well as in building automated systems that make data insights more accessible.
